# Prior Authorization Policy: OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) for Post-Concussion Syndrome Headache

**Policy Number:** PA-PCS-BTX-001
**Effective Date:** 2024-01-01
**Review Date:** 2025-01-01

## Overview

This policy outlines the criteria for prior authorization of OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injections for the treatment of chronic headache associated with Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS).

**Note:** The use of Botox for headache specifically attributed *only* to PCS is generally considered **investigational and not medically necessary** based on current evidence. This policy primarily addresses requests where chronic migraine criteria are also met post-concussion.

## Criteria for Approval

Botox for headache following concussion may be considered medically necessary and approved **only if ALL** of the following criteria are met:

1.  **Diagnosis:** The patient meets the diagnostic criteria for **Chronic Migraine** (headaches on 15 or more days per month for >3 months, with migraine features on at least 8 days per month) that began or significantly worsened following a concussion.
2.  **PCS Diagnosis:** The patient has a diagnosis of Post-Concussion Syndrome, but the headache pattern aligns with chronic migraine.
3.  **Age:** Patient is 18 years of age or older.
4.  **Failed Standard Migraine Prophylaxis:** The patient has experienced inadequate response, intolerance, or contraindication to trials of **at least two (2)** different classes of standard oral prophylactic medications for migraine (e.g., beta-blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants) at adequate doses and durations.
5.  **Exclusion of Medication Overuse Headache:** Medication overuse headache has been reasonably excluded or addressed.
6.  **Qualified Prescriber:** Injections are prescribed and will be administered by a qualified specialist (e.g., Neurologist) experienced in treating chronic migraine with Botox.

## Documentation Requirements

*   Clinical notes documenting the history of concussion, onset/worsening of headaches post-concussion, and confirmation of Chronic Migraine diagnostic criteria (headache frequency, duration, characteristics).
*   Detailed headache diary or log for at least one month prior to request.
*   Documentation of trials (medication name, dose, duration, reason for failure/discontinuation) of at least two standard oral migraine prophylactic agents from different classes.
*   Confirmation that medication overuse headache is not the primary driver.

## Exclusions

*   Headache pattern consistent with episodic migraine or other headache types (e.g., tension-type) without meeting chronic migraine criteria.
*   Treatment requested *solely* for Post-Concussion Syndrome symptoms other than chronic migraine-pattern headache.
*   Failure to meet trial requirements for standard oral prophylactics.
*   Concurrent use with other botulinum toxin products.
