**Policy Number:** PA-LBP-MRI-001
**Effective Date:** 2024-01-01
**Review Date:** 2025-01-01

## Overview

This policy outlines the criteria for prior authorization of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans for the evaluation of non-specific low back pain (LBP).

## Criteria for Approval

MRI for LBP is considered medically necessary and may be approved **only if ALL** of the following criteria are met:

1.  **Duration:** Persistence of LBP for at least **six (6) weeks** despite conservative therapy (e.g., physical therapy, NSAIDs).
2.  **Red Flags:** Presence of **at least one** "red flag" symptom/sign suggesting a serious underlying condition, such as:
    *   Progressive or severe neurologic deficit (e.g., foot drop, cauda equina syndrome symptoms like saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder incontinence).
    *   History of cancer with new-onset back pain.
    *   Suspected spinal infection (e.g., fever, IV drug use history, recent bacterial infection).
    *   Significant trauma relative to age.
    *   Unexplained weight loss.
3.  **Failed Conservative Therapy:** Documentation of trial and failure, contraindication, or intolerance to conservative management.
4.  **Exclusion:** The request is **not** for routine screening or surveillance in the absence of new symptoms or findings.

## Documentation Requirements

*   Detailed clinical notes documenting history, physical examination findings (including neurological exam), duration of symptoms, and specific red flags (if present).
*   Record of conservative therapies tried, including duration and response.
*   Specific clinical question(s) the MRI is expected to answer.

## Exclusions

*   Repeat MRI within 6 months without significant clinical change or new red flags.
*   MRI solely for occupational screening or medico-legal purposes without clinical indications.
*   Requests not meeting the criteria outlined above.

## Applicable Codes (Examples, Not Exhaustive)

*   **ICD-10:** M54.5 (Low back pain), M51.x (Thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbosacral intervertebral disc disorders), G83.x (Paralytic syndromes), R29.6 (Nervous system disorder)
*   **CPT:** 72148 (MRI lumbar spine without contrast), 72149 (with contrast), 72158 (with and without contrast)
